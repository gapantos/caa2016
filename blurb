CAA 2016 Blurb.


This poster is intended as a thought-piece on the application of 3D documentation in archaeological excavations as of 2015/2016.  It is intended for anyone involved in intensive photogrammetric documentation of archaeological excavations regardless of experience. The viewer is encouraged to explore the diagram slowly and consider not only what they do with their data now, but question why the collect this data and in what new way this data might be used exploited in the future.

There is no shortage of studies that demonstrate how the technology can replicate existing recording methods to higher fidelity and with faster capture rates* than traditional means, and researchers are increasingly exploring how the data may afford novel ways of interrogating the archaeological record. However, for every new opportunity, there are accompanying challenges including problems that result from limitations of technology and training that could be solved with greater investment, to more intractable problems of the variability of archaeological process and theoretical questions on what the data we collect actually represents.

Many of the topics highlighted may appear or indeed are 'obvious' and well known, but at the time of writing, seemingly seldom discussed despite the continued growth intensive 3D data collection in the field. Ultimately the poster seeks to encourage those involved in this data capture in the field not only to question what the limitations are, but to fully familiarise themselves with their final aims of this data, what it represents and why they do it so that we can move the discussion on to what is needed to realise the new potentials of these data sets.


*in some circumstances, less so in others.
